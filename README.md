# T20 International Cricket Match Winner Predictor üèè

## Overview
Cricket lovers, this one's for you! This project predicts the winner of T20 International cricket matches using **Machine Learning** and historical match data. After testing multiple models, **Random Forest Classifier** came out on top with an impressive **95% accuracy**, beating **Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost, and AdaBoost**. To make things even better, we built an **interactive GUI** that lets you predict match outcomes in real time!

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **GUI Development:** Tkinter
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and formatted T20 match data.
   - Handled missing values and converted categorical data.
   
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Selected key factors influencing match results, like team performance, venue, and toss outcome.
   
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Tested multiple ML models.
   - Achieved the best accuracy (**95%**) with **Random Forest**.
   
4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Designed an **interactive GUI** so anyone can predict match results easily.

## Key Learnings
- **Supervised Learning & Model Evaluation:**
  - Compared classifiers to understand strengths and weaknesses.
  
- **Feature Engineering & Selection:**
  - Extracted meaningful insights to improve predictions.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Used GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV to optimize models.
  
- **Data Preprocessing & Visualization:**
  - Explored trends using EDA techniques.
  
- **Model Deployment:**
  - Built a **Tkinter-based GUI** to make predictions accessible to everyone.

## üöÄ How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NihalAli19/T20ICricketPrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd T20ICricketPrediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üîÆ What's Next?
- Enhance accuracy with Deep Learning (LSTMs, Neural Networks, etc.).
- Include additional features like player stats and weather conditions.
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
