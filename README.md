# MachineLearning-T20ICricketWinnerPredictonModel
This project predicts the winner of T20 International cricket matches using historical data and machine learning. The Random Forest Classifier achieved 95% accuracy, outperforming other algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. Key features include interactive GUIs for match prediction.


Overview:

The T20I Cricket Prediction Model uses machine learning to predict the winner of T20 International cricket matches based on historical data. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier, which achieved 95% accuracy, outperforming other models like Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.


Features:

Winner Prediction: Predict match outcomes based on teams, venue, and toss decisions.


Interactive GUIs:

Match Prediction Interface

Historical Match Data Explorer

Ground-Specific Performance Analysis


Data: Aggregated ball-by-ball match dataset in csv file with no duplicates.


Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Random Forest Classifier

GUI Frameworks (Tkinter/Streamlit)


Future Enhancements:

Real-time predictions with live match data.

Expanded GUIs for player and strategy-based analytics.
